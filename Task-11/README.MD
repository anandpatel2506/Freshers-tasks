This folder contains the codes for developing a multiplayer pong game.Here i used javascript and HTML. Here i updated, rendered and animated.
After that by the help of coordinate geometry i created two paddle and one ball.After creating I had assigned unique key to control them.
For player1 I had used left and right arrow. For player 2 i had assigned a and d for moving left and right.
