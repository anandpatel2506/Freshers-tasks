## Self -Evaluation- 
After learning python some months i had not practiced it but when i started the first task of FOSS my logic thinking                     ability was coming back and i am also remembering the forgotten things. I can think logic for various program.So this                   helped me a lot to keep me in a pace.






## Why I should be in this club-
* I am very good at developing logic for a program.
* I am very keen and fast learner.
* I will give my 100 percent to the club.Whatever the task they will give i will put my all efforts to do.
* I know python.
* I am having a big dream to be a coder.So this club will surely help me.
* I had done Diploma in Computer management.
* I will put my all the efforts to give benefits to myself and the club.
* I will surely work under the discipline.
* I will be regular in all the club activities.
