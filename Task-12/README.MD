In this task I had taken the reference of given reverse.py (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3sOPp4yzeLTdHZiazhmNFZ2VEE/view?usp=sharing) 
file.As their are three functions first is xor, shift and encode. I had made the function reverseshift and decode function in which decode function 
converts the hex file into string and reverseshift just do the work opposite of shift.In this way i developed the code after that for finding the key i just 
call the functions in opposite way as it has called in that reverse.py file.
