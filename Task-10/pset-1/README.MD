**HelloWorld.c**


This was very easy to make ,in this program I have to input a name so that it just prints HelloWorld and then the given name.So for this I used 
scanf to take input then printf to print it.


**Pyramid.c**


 In this problem I have to make a program which prints the pyramid of the size given by the user,here I developed it by the help of looping. 
Like first I started my loop from i to the height given for pyramid then i just counted the number of times I have to print the spaces and "#". In this way i completed this task.

In this task we have to check the type of card like mastercard ,visa etc.So here I used looping and just applid the condition for each card.The logic is to first check the size of the card number which I implemented by loop and counter then after checking I applied the loop for checking the condition which was given in algorithm then after this I checked the first two digit of card to print mastercard or visa.
