This folder contains program of cli app, output of CLI app


In this program we have to develope a command line interface app for twitter using go language.


This app takes twitter handler as a input and after processing we will get the output and that output is get stored in a txt file named as userhandler.txt

**Walkthrough**
In starting you first need to have a twitter account for this then next you have to apply for twiiter developer there you have to provide some information about your CLI app then next you have to apply for the tokens. So after this you will get tokens. Then next you have to write a code in go language there you need to import a packag named as dghubble.Here you need to link your tokkens with the go program.Then after this you will get the name of followers next you have to write all his name in a text fil (in my case its name is userhandler).After creating this program run it on command line by writing *go run twitterHandler.go*.
