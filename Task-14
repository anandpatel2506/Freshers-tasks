### I am sharing my experience regarding bandit
I started the bandit server by writing
ssh bandit@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
then after this it asked me password  which was bandit0 thenafter this i used ls file so their I found a readme file by the help of cat 
I opened it and then i found password for next level(level 1) from here.Then after this I exit it then again i called the server by 
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
by this I opened my level 1 and the entered the above accesed password.And here also by the help[ of ls i abound a file "-" here so I opened it by the help of cat ~./- and get the password of next level.
again i exited and recalled the server by above commands just replacing 1 by 2 and then i entered the above accessed password in this then I got a file named as "spaces in this filename" i open this file by 
"cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename" and i agin got the password and then i exited and recalled the server by entering the password.And by entering the ls I got a directory named as inhere in which i have to finad a file which is human readable and of size 1033 and it is not executable.I dounded this file by 
"find -readable – size 1033c ! -executable" and then "cat ./-file07".So in this way got level 5 and entered into level 6 then I entered  "find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>&1 | grep -F -v Permission" this I founded the key for next level.In next level i get to know that their is data.txt file in which the key is on millionth, so for this I entered the command "cat data.txt | grep millionth" and then i got the key for next level and then in next levelget to know that 
their is file named as data.txt in which only one line is coming once and the code is in that line so for this i used "sort data.txt | uniq -u" so by this i got the key and entered in the next level.After this in level 9 the password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, beginning with several ‘=’ characters so for this used 
"strings data.txt | grep ==" so i get the key from here then I then for another it was written that the password is in a file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data so i founded the password by "base64 -d data.txt".


In all these commands as their is the use of commands like grep, uniq, and etc so i had used man and some google searches for what they to in this way i completed the bandit upto level 10
