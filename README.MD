## Self -Evaluation- 
After learning python some months i had not practiced it but when i started the first task of FOSS my logic thinking                     ability was coming back and i am also remembering the forgotten things. I can think logic for various program.So this                   helped me a lot to keep me in a pace.

## What i am going to do in next 6 months-
###     If i am selected - 
In next 6 months i will put my all the efforts to learn coding as much as i can  and getting new experience.                            and I will also try to trigger my goal i.e. GSoc.
