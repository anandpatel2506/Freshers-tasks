**caesar**

I this task a plaintext is given then next a key is given so that we have to use a formula so that each text of a plaintext is incrmnted by the given key and thus we get a ciphertext.Here I used he array and accessed each text by the help of indexing in C.

I started this by a same logic as that of caesar but here the key is in character format so I took the help from ASCII so first I converted the key (which is a text) into its corresponding ASCII value then I took each character of plain text and then converted it into its corresponding ASCII value.After this I applied the formula for encrypting it which is simply a algorithm which changes the character of plain text according to the given key.After this I converted the ASCII value in its corresponding character and displayed it.In this way I completed this program.
